        After watching the videos, there are revision notes to re-check the form of the grammar. Following this, you can practice using the grammar by completing the multiple-choice exercises and an end of unit test. Results from the practice questions and unit test are saved to your profile in the “quizzes tab” so you can check your answers and correct your mistakes.

These assignments allow you to put the grammar you have learnt into practice. The speaking and writing assignments are corrected by the highly qualified and experienced teachers from Influential English language school. They will give you written feedback on the areas you did well and what you can do to improve!
